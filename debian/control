Description: Quicktime 4 Linux Cinelerra internal library
 Quicktime 4 Linux was the first convenient way to read and write 
 uncompressed Quicktime movies on Linux. Today Quicktime 4 Linux 
 is intended for content creation and uncompressed movies. These 
 usually arise during the production phase and not the consumer 
 phase of a movie. It has improvements in colormodel support, 
 bit depth, accuracy, reliability, and codecs, while not 
 stressing economy. 
 .
 Users wishing for a consumer library should use OpenQuicktime or FFMPEG.
 .

Description: advanced editing and manipulation of MPEG streams (cinelerra's internal) 
 Libmpeg3 supports advanced editing and manipulation of MPEG streams. 
 MPEG is normally a last mile format but with libmpeg3 you can edit 
 it like a first mile solution. 
 .
 Unless you have a need for MPEG editing and copying, you're better 
 off using a consumer library like FFMPEG.
